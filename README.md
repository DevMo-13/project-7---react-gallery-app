# Project 7 - React Gallery App
 Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Project 7 - React Gallery App

This project uses the React library to create an image gallery app. 
Using the Create React App tool, the initial project was set up, and then:
- JavaScript and JSX was used to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
- React Router was used to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
- Axios was used to fetch data from the Flickr API, and the data was used to display images.
- Logic was also added to handle search and various requirements of the project.

In the terminal, use 'npm start' to initialize the app, after downloading the project files and dependencies.
